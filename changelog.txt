1.3.00 - 02-19-09 - Performed much code cleaning.
1.3.01 - 03-30-09 - BUG FIX - when uploading FULL file. If v_status column is left out, would re-activate deactivated items.
1.3.02 - 03-30-09 - BUG FIX - fixed blank manufactuers import where empty v_manufacturers_name when blank was not reset correctly
1.3.03 - 09-08-09 - Begins Major Code Revisions
1.3.03 Notes:
- Simplified ?langer=install and ?langer=remove  "langer" to "epinstaller", removed ?langer=installnew
- removed paypal request for donations!!
- no longer creates first export file
- changed logic of function ep_chmod_check() ... it now ONLY checks to see if the directory exist and is writeable and fails if either is not true.
  Also removed automatic attemps to chmod() throught this script - this is not secure.
09-15-09 - Decided to also split this mod off properly by adding TAB (like CSV and OSC)
09-29-09 - Created multiple exports for product attributes, option names, and option values
09-29-09 - updates Price/Qty/Breaks export code to use while statement. Now allow for unlimited in number of price breaks! 
10-01-09 - phazie's array definitions for filelayouts are more efficient and also more code readible and mod-able. array_merger() if very inefficient
           this required some tweaking in other places
         - found some places in the download code that I replace with exclusion code to speed up downloads. No sense executing code that wasn't needed.
         - export time in now in 24-hour:minute:second which makes better sense to me
10-02-09 - added metatags for products as in phazie's csv version - so far testing is good
10-05-09 - it is VERY important to have the correct delimiter set or the import of information will fail

1.3.04 - 10-13-09 - Fixed function call errors and added filtering check for UPC and UOM mods when downloading files
1.3.05 - 10-14-09 - Auto switching for file extention fixed dependant on delimitor <tab> or <comma>
                  - Somehow when adding a new item with empty manufacturer, it was being assigned the previously imported manufactures id. Spelling error in code!

4.0.00 - 12-21-09 - Begin Move to 4.0.000 beta
4.0.01 - 12-22-09 - Ha! Manufacturers weren't being created because I left off the "s" in manufacturers!
4.0.02 - 06-03-10 - changed all price_as to price_uom for unit of measure. This is a logical correction. Databases updated
                    ALTER TABLE products ADD products_upc VARCHAR(32) AFTER products_model;
                    ALTER TABLE products ADD products_price_uom VARCHAR(2) AFTER products_price;
4.0.03 - 11-19-2010 Fixed bug where v_date_avail (products_date_available) wasn't being set to NULL correctly.
4.0.04 - 11-22-2010 worked on quantity discount import code. now removes old discounts when discount type or number of discounts changes
4.0.05 - 11-23-2010 more work on quantity breaks. Eliminated the v_discount_id column since all discounts are entered at once fresh i'm just using loop index
         11-23-2010 added products_status to the Model/Price/Qty and Model/Price/Breaks
4.0.06 - 12-02-2010 added uninstall button on form page, removed unnecessary tables from form page
         12-02-2010 removed 'v_discount_id_' from export file layout - no longer needed
         12-02-2010 add EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_MAX_QTY_DISCOUNTS variable to configuration page
4.0.07 - 12-02-2010 adding categories image, description and metadata export/import
         12-03-2010 completing Categories image/description/metadata export/import feature!
4.0.08 - 12-07-2010 found error: when uploading Model/Price/Qty to set Specials Pricing, quantity discounts are being wiped
4.0.09 - 12-10-2010 time to start breaking this down and using more functional design (and hopefully lead toward an OO based design)
         12-10-2010 move all file layout to functions now using $filelayout = ep_4_set_filelayout();
         12-11-2010 broke out all export code into easypopulate_4_export.php - This is included with a require_once() statement.
                    I am doing this so I can start to break this mod into more functional sections.
         12-13-2010 broke out all import code into easypopulate_4_import.php
         12-13-2010 moved these notes to easypopulate_4_changelog.php
         12-13-2010 changing the way categories are imported and exported. now using single column for categories where categories are separated
                    by a delimeter. Should allow "unlimited" category depth, but still a practical limit of 256 character for excel although
                    OpenOffice is not restricted. Multi-lingual categories should be achievable now.
         12-14-2010 beginning work on category import using single delimeted column 
         12-15-2010 export of mult-lingual categories is now working. Export/Import of "categorymeta" works correctly to assing multi-lingual values
                    Have not tested "full" import with multi-lingual categories. Must look closely at code. I may have to make the "full" import
                    only work with default language, and use 'categorymeta' for updating other languages. 
                    Why? Because error checking on import may become to onerous.
         12-16-2010 fixed small error in configuration keys where key was misspelled; removed all references to now defunct $max_categories
4.0.10 - 12-16-2010 Simple single-line attribute import code merged into EP4. Initial testing is good.
         12-21-2010 Auto checking of installed mods by checking if table columns exist, new fuction for checking table column, old one didn't work
4.0.11 - 03-09-2011 Removed EOREOR from export files, updated README with info about attribute importing, included example of Attrib-EP-xxx.CSV file.
         04-04-2011 Updated README.txt, added GPL license.txt file, added INSTALL.txt file. Replaced easypopulate_4_changelog.php with changelog.txt to avoid confusion.
4.0.12 - 11-04-2011 Fixed issue with export and import where legacy data may have NULL values set for manufacturers_id in the products table. This should be 0, but NULL was set in some earlier versions of EP.
4.0.13 - 11-08-2011 Fixed bug where meta tags statuses were being changed when doing an import such at PriceQty-EP. Needed to add meta tags statuses to $default_these[] in the import file.
                    Added support for custom products field products_gpc for google product category. For use with custom version of google merchant feeder.
4.0.14 - 11-09-2011 Some code enhancements and clean up.
         11-10-2011 Tentative fixes for multi-lingual stores. This codes builds entries in TABLE_CATEGORIES_DESCRIPTION for each language defined in the store, not just what's in the import file.
                    Have yet to properly process the additional languages at import. CategoryMeta does work, but the FULL import is not complete. Main issue: if the default language isn't "1" then the import script for
                    categories fails. This instead needs to cycle through each installed category, not start at "1".
         11-14-2011 BUG Fix: when importing a new manufacturer, the entry for each installed language for TABLE_MANUFACTURERS_INFO was not being created. If not created, this field is not editable within the admin. 
4.0.15 - 11-15-2011 Performance Boost: Added a quick fix for better performance on Import by adding a boolean variable $ep_feedback. If set to false, EP4 will skip most
                    reporting of new and updated products at end of script. This really saves on memory and execution time. All errors are still reported. 
         11-23-2011 More testing on performance of script. Export has been modified to ONLY export to the installed EP directory. This way I can write directly
                    to the export file rather than building a massive string to stream to client machine. This also conserves a great deal of memory.
                    This same "fix" should be implemented into the Import code which would require you to first upload the file, then execute the import from the
                    remote directory.
         12-05-2011 Some major changes. Changing the work flow per the note above. Added code to manage the CSV file on the remote machine. 
                    You now must first upload your EP file, then click the Import link to import. You can save exported file by right-clicking
                    their link and selecting "save-as". Is there another way to do this? This code needs a lot of clean-up and testing before 
                    submitting to github.
4.0.16 - 12-07-2011 Basic file management completed. Adding Split function for large data files. This will be executed first after uploading a large file.
                    Once file has been split, it can then be imported. This will also work for large files that have been exported... If you are using old ver
                    of Excel (with 65,000 rows limit) you can split your export file into smaller chunks. Langer had good forsight for file spitting, I just didn't
                    agree with his approach.
         12-08-2011 Split function seems to be working well. Need to add configuration variables to set the # of records to split on. 
                    I finally identified the problem with sites with MASSIVE data (like 100,000 on up products). It has to do with updating the price sorter:
                    After each import, Langer would call an update_prices script, and then also call zen_expire_specials if any specials were detected. However,
                    these scripts will time out on a server with very large databases. I am wondering what I am missing on import that I have to update ALL the pricing 
                    in one go instead of it being correct on each update.
         12-09-2011 Bug Fixed: manaufacturers_name length exceeds database field size 
                    Bug Fixed: wasn't checking length of category names. Now aborts that product's line if a category_name is too long
                    Updated: products_model length exceeds database file size (cleaned code related to this)
                    Added warnings to product_names and products_url lengths exceeded, but permitted adding/importing to catalog
                    I suppose mata-tags should also have this code (these are varchar 255).
         12-11-2011 More minor code clean-up. Will I ever finish? The import flow logic needs to be revisited... it's very "duck tape and bailing wire"
                    Pushing current code to github.     
4.0.17 - 12-15-2011 Added support for installing on Zencart 1.5.
         12-16-2011 BUG Fix: When importing multi-lingual file with missing language columns on a NEW product, additional laguage entries were not being created
                    in the TABLE_PRODUCTS_DESCRIPTION table.
         12-20-2011 BUG Fix: Multi-lingual category import was not working correctly. I believe I NOW have correctly solved this issue! (whoot!! whoot!!)
                    I wasn't sure I'd figure it out, and perhaps my solution is not the most efficient, but creating all entries at import for    
                    all your defined languages is working and quite an accomplishment. I do need to add some additional error trapping.
         12-21-2011 Error Trapping. So far, you MUST have a v_categories_name_1 to function correctly. Subsequent v_categories_?? definitions may be omitted. If omitted,
                    the missing column will be defaulted to v_categories_name_1.
         12-22-2011 Actually, v_categories_name_1 is not exact. You must have your lowest defined language. This is used as a "pivot" for adding other language entries.
                    This means that if you have more than one language define, and you add a new product (you need a category to do this) but do not define your additional
                    Language entries, that you have something to default to.
                    NOTE: Zencart "bug"? If you add a language, then later remove that language, the language entries are left in the databases!
         12-23-2011 Added rudimentary language support to Attributes Import. Basically, all languages are defaulted to the values
                    entered. No effort is made yet to define which is the default, they are just set the same. This step is being take to ensure that the 
                    required entries are properly being created so further updates or editing can be done.
4.0.18 - 01-27-2012 Added Improved handling for UTF8 Multi-Byte Characters for languages such as Greek. Should work for others but no data yet for testing Russian or Simplified Chineese
                    Added Configuration Variable EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_CURLY_QUOTES with 3 options. 0-Don't Convert, 1-Convert to Basic Symbols, 2-Convert to HTML codes
                    Added support for products_msrp mod.
4.0.19 - 01-28-2012 Fixed bug in file splitting where subseqent splits appended to previously split files instead of overwritting them.
4.0.20 - 04-10-2012 Significant work on attributes import. Two Attribute Import/Export files are now available. Attrib-Basic-EP and Attrib-Detailed-EP.
                    Attrib-Basic-EP is used to create your products_options_name and products_options_values_name with a given product_options_type and assign 
                    this attribute set to a products_model. Multiple languages are supported. Important: You must have language id 1 (English by default install).
                    The Basic sheet can only create new attributes or update (add to) attributes for a given products_model. There is no provision yet for removing attributes
                    so this must be done from within the admin.
                    Attrib-Detailed-EP is used After you have imported your Basic attributes. The Detailed sheet can be used to update all vital settings for an attribute on a 
                    given products_model. Note that the Detailed sheet does NOT create products_options_name or products_options_values_name entries. NOR does the Detailed sheet
                    add or remove entries. 
                    The examples/ directory contains a new sample CSV file for importing attributes.
         04-12-2012 Added option to deal with character 0x92 (a right single quote) that appears to come from Western Europe (window 1252) encoding. This can also be corrected when
                    saving your CSV file and selecting either utf-8 or iso-8859-1. Added settings info on right side of screen.
                    NOTE: If \"" (which looks like an escape sequence) is in your input file, it will break the import. 
         04-13-2012 Expanded the filterable downloads to allow Complete Products, Model/Price/Qty, and Model/Price Breaks. Some minor changes to EP4 page.
         04-23-2012 Added configuration variables for MetaTags and Music Exports. If enabled, they allow for the additional columns to be exported.
         04-24-2012 Completed import/export for products_type = 2, Music (Artist, Record Company, Genre)
         04-25-2012 Concept for alternate column header names added to the import code. Needs fleshing out and a way for user interaction.
         04-30-2012 Added products_priced_by_attribute and product_is_always_free_shipping to the main products export/import file layout
		 05-01-2012 Added NEW file to support Featured Items export/import
         05-03-2012 Added "curly quotes" check for categories names import
         05-08-2012 More "curly quotes" checks added
4.0.21   06-01-2012	Fix to v_products_type on import.
                    Added new solution for checking database collation... this makes a difference when using 1.38/139 as the functions do not return field lengths correctly.
                    Fixed "security" issue with zencart 1.5
4.0.22 	 03-01-2014	SBA_Stock: Added functionality to manage total stock of items when Stock By Attributes (SBA) is installed and items are or are not tracked by SBA.
						Files modified: admin/easypopulate_4.php, easypopulate_4_import.php, easypopulate_4_export.php and admin/includes/functions/extra_functions/easypopulate_4_functions.php.
4.0.23 	 07-13-2014	Upgrade to ZC 1.5.3. Incorporated usage of mysqli_ related functions where mysql_ functions were used to continue functionality in older versions but allow
					continued operation in newer ZC versions.  Also added 
					additional SBA functionality for import and export.  SBA is 
					still tied to an older version of SBA and 
					needs to be updated to reflect Potterhouse's version.  Also
					modified the basic attribute process of updating the sort order
					to use a factor of 10 instead of a factor of 1 when importing
					basic attributes.  Ideally, the sort order would remain as
					previously assigned if the product existed and be adjusted as
					necessary to remain in the desired sort order; however, at 
					least this way room is provided between EP4 updates to add
					additional options between existing options.  
					In admin/easypopulate_4_attrib.php is a variable 
					$products_sort_order_increment that is currently set to 10 
					so that options will be added first at the value of 1 as 
					assigned in the same file, then will increment to 
					10, 20, 30, etc... for each subsequent option upon import 
					of the basic file.
4.0.24   07-15-2014 Fixed typo in attribute import (missing $ on variable name), and also corrected the way index increment was
					calculated.
4.0.25   10-10-2014		Added capability of using EP4 with modifications shown 
					in potteryhouse's version of SBA. (Recognizes customid column).
					This may also open EP4 to other versions of SBA; however, 
					this code has not been tested on other versions of SBA that 
					use the customid field.  The detailed export was updated; 
					however, removal of old SBA records still needs to be
					addressed.  Updated the README text a little.
4.0.26   10-19-2014      Added the sort_id associated with categories.  Import and Export are
                         through the Categories Only (with Metatags) file(s).  If column is present
                         then the sort_id will be modified accordingly.  If the column is absent
                         there will be no change of the category's sort_order.
4.0.26a  10-25-2014      Corrected the display of the SBA options.  Previously SBA menu options
					displayed for all users not just those that had SBA installed.  This was
					the only modification made to this version.
4.0.26b  10-26-2014		Added a menu display of the status of SBA being installed similar to other
					options previously incorporated by chadderruski (such as products short
					descriptions, product unit of measure, etc...) Also updated some of the
					html formatting.
4.0.27   10-27-2014      Provided export of product and category URIs as generated from the admin
					function zen_catalog_href_link.  If CEON URI Mapping is installed, then
					the active uri is provided by that code.  Other URI rewriters may provide
					the same functionality when installed and active; however, that has not
					been tested.
4.0.28   01-03-2015      Added bypass to mb_internal_string and notification.
					Also modified version check to support ZC 1.5.4 and above.
					Future versions of ZC may still require this to be revised, but at least
					this program will not need to be updated merely to support a version check.
					Incorporated admin logging of database inserts and updates similar (and beyond)
					those contained in ZC 1.5.4.  Deletions were not incorporated.
4.0.29   04-03-2015		Added support for products_map modification (Manufacturer's Advertised Price)
					Added MSRP export to areas where previously begun but not fully incorporated.
					Modified import of customid for SBA-detailed-attributes to treat as a string.
					Began incorporating language overrides, specifically with German as the first alternate language.
					Added support for the plugin dual pricing.
4.0.30   06-27-2015		Added a new way of displaying files on the EP4 screen to show
					more information such as the prefix to the file types that are
					processed.  This is to reduce the questions related to not
					reading the instructions and understanding that certain files
					are processed only by their name prefix.  Everything else is 
					processed as if it was a full update file.  Also addressed a
					warning received in PHP 5.4+ related to testing a variable not
					initialized.  Previously 'if (!$error)' was sufficient, which
					it is if $error has been assigned; however, if not assigned,
					this results in a warning message in the logs folder.  So,
					instead to maintain consistent usage/functionality will check
					if it is set and if it is set to verify that it is not an
					error, and if it never was set then that would need to be 
					known as well.  end result: if (!$error) { has been changed to
					if ((isset($error) && !$error) || !isset($error)) {.
4.0.31   08-01-2015		Corrected how dates are imported for specials in PHP 5.5 - 5.6 to match
					how ZC has to prevent dates converting from 0001-01-01 to 1970-01-01.
					Added ability to import using products_id.
					Modified method of handling the storage directory.  Previous versions
					if the admin directory was desired had to be entered and
					would be stored in the database.  There is no other default
					ZC function that stores the admin directory in the database.
					This could become a security issue if access to the database
					is somehow inappropriately obtained.
					Modified how some of the queries are handled to ensure
					continued compatibility with ZC.
					Modified the output links to account for files being
					stored in different locations on the server based on
					catalog/admin selections.
4.0.32	02-08-2016		Updated for PHP 7.0 compatibility.
				Corrected use of verifying that constant is in use and needs to be defined.
				Completed incorporation of the German Language version of EP4 which allows for
					EP4 to now be translated to other languages.  Assistance always welcome!
				Converted from storing web page data via $_GET to $_POST operations.  Retrieval of files
					is still by $_GET when selecting the download link(s) as well as links to generate
					new files to modify unless the dropdowns at the top of the screen are used. This
					also was a change away from using $_REQUEST to $_POST offering stricter
					control of data transport.
				Added checks in files that are "required" to validate that the file is being run from within
					ZC by verification of a constant being defined.
				Incorporated numerous notifiers to support expandability. (A BookX addon is in development by a 
					third party and	will be looked at for easy incorporation to minimize the effort of it 
					and other plugins being incorporated.)
				Transitioned import queries to using bindVars to minimize errors that introduced by adding to the
					code and to better handle the data being imported.  This is also in support of packaging
					EP4 as a downloadable plugin on the zen cart site.
				Revised the Product Description table modification process for updates allowing any of the fields
					or a combination of any of the fields to not be included in the update file, though the
					base fields necessary would be the products_id (internally identified if not directly
					provided), and the language_id which is identified off of the languages installed to ZC.
					This also made improvements to the use of the short product description that was added
					by chadd.
				Added ep4_curly_quotes operations to several of the import fields.
				Updated the sql install to clarify the areas affected by some of the settings.
				Modified how categories were updated somewhat similar to how products/products Description 
					were affected; however, it does appear that additional work is necessary with that section
					unfortunately as absence of the categories_description with the categories_name in place
					will cause a SQL error because of an extra comma before the WHERE statement. :/
				Similar process for category metatags was incorporated and has the same issue as categories and needs
					to incorporate the processing added to product description updating to prevent a SQL error
					if metatags_description is not included in the import.
				Corrected an existing issue with short description for products that did not properly account for 
					a language identifier.
				Moved additional file for ZC 1.5.x into the main file path instead of being an additional file/folder
					with which to contend.  Software remains functional on pre-1.5.x with appropriate action taken
					to install that version's needed file(s).
				Generated a module file to support the filelayout instead of having it within an additional function
					file as a function.  This was to support adequate incorporation of notifiers without making
					the functions file a class of its own and other work arounds.
4.0.33	02-29-2016		Added a filter to prevent custom field entries from being overwritten on import if
					the import file doesn't include the field.  If the field is in the import file,
					but the data for the row is blank, then the data for that field will be cleared.  If
					the field is not present, then any data that exists for that field will remain 
					intact whether the admin->configuration->Easy Populate 4->User Defined Fields is
					populated or blank.
				Added some "folder" functionality to force the selection of the import file being in the
					admin directory if catalog was selected and the entered path really points to
					the admin directory.  This functionality occurs in the configuration window as 
					well as when accessing EP4 for any operation.
				Removed the bypassed code in admin/includes/functions/extra_functions that previously
					was used for export formatting.  This code was incorporated into a module file
					in 4.0.32.
				Added notifiers throughout to support extending the code to support other bulk related
					data.  Specifically targeted bookx.
				Corrected the use of importing date_available and date_added as this had been affected
					by use of bindVars without consideration of potential values.
				Added a .htaccess file that only includes permission for .csv and .txt files based off
					of the admin/.htaccess file available from ZC 1.5.4.
				Updated instructions to add some additional considerations.
				EP4 had been submitted for download, download from ZC is available from:

4.0.33a  03/17/2016             Updated version check location to reflect the final submission/accepted download location of:
                                        https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=2069
4.0.34   03/19/2016             After report of an issue with EP4.0.33 being used on ZC 1.5.5, a change was made to how paths are
                                        generated for admin side related code.
                                On import of priceqty files, the absence of language designated fields
                                	now that the products description section has been rewritten
                                	would cause a sql error on update.  This has been resolved.
4.0.34.a 04/02/2016             Apply correction to importing on category information.  An attempt was previously made to centralize
                                        the use of the delimiter between categories.  The technical reason for this not working as
                                        expected was that the multi-byte function that acts on the data required the delimiter to
                                        be properly formatted regex type expression.  The UTF-8 version of the character was not
                                        properly formatted and no further action was taken on the variable (until now).  This restores
                                        EP4 to its full functionality before attempting to make that improvement.
4.0.35   04/29/2016             Added an additional notifier to follow the loading of the admin's header.php file.  The header.php 
                                        file also loads JQuery, such that if JQuery was loaded in an earlier notifier, it would be
                                        overridden within the header.php file when JQuery is loaded without consideration of previous
                                        loadings/presence.
                                Full upgrade requires remove/install of the configuration settings, otherwise this version added a 
                                        default to activate featured product that have an expiration date that is "blank" (0001-01-01)
                                Added a notifier to follow loading the admin header.php file to support adding jquery related loads in 
                                        a logical location rather than forcing the use of an alternative notifier.
                                Modified the import of featured product to expand the capability and use of featured
                                        product management.
                                Incorporated data cleaning on import of basic attributes.
                                Modified import file to fallback to strlen comparison if mb_strlen is not installed/active on a site.
                                Expanded the use of the code with systems that do not have mb_
                                Added language fallback to english capability if the SESSION['language'] folder does not exist for EP4 menus.
                                Modified one import bitwise operator to a comparison operator (& to &&).
4.0.35.ZC 04/29/2016            Modified version number as github contained 4.0.35 and wanted to be sure that users that downloaded
                                        that version would receive notification of the updated file.  This is the version
                                        submitted to ZC.
4.0.35.ZC.2 10/03/2016          Correctedissues related to version 4.0.35.ZC and incorporated comments received by
                                        users of the program as identified in the ZC forum including:
                                        Modified the usage and installation instructions to try to provide 
                                          clearer direction in particular areas.
                                        Cleaned up some documentation.
                                        Improved system response/notification following upload of a csv file.
                                        Resequenced some coding for readibility and consistency.
                                        Corrected sanitization code that was incorrectly implemented, in some cases 
                                          requiring more information to be entered in an import file than expected or
                                          planned.
                                        Increased the usability of alternate primary keys in import/export of data.
                                        Pulled some import file types into their own unique file to:
                                          1) simplify readibility
                                          2) reduce program load demand (at this time research indicates that files
                                             incorporated within if statements are not loaded as part of the 
                                             overall program execution until needed.)
                                          3) Lead into other structures that could be added to the code to offer
                                             further expandibility.
                                          4) Maintain structures to also lead into code execution from outside of the
                                             main program controller and offer an interface with external code.
                                        Removed excess code execution that performed no function. In some cases by
                                          commenting out the code, in others by removing it.
                                        Modifying some functions to in some cases incorporate ZC code improvments
                                          such as using zen_db_input instead of just addslashes as the ZC version
                                          of the data cleansing is improved with later versions of ZC to use 
                                          functions other than just the basic addslashes PHP code.
                                        Furthered addressing PHP 7.X related warnings by further pre-defining variables
                                          before their first use.
                                        In some cases reduced the run time of some code by accessing PHP functions
                                          to capture the expected/necessary data rather than unnecessary loops.
                                        Improved error reporting screen now that the primary key can be changed.
                                        Forced unsetting of variables in functions that generated "one-time use" 
                                          variables.
                                        Modified the install code to improve the process for future upgrades.
                                        Updated one of the dropdowns to reflect the datatype included with that option.
                                        Added German installation instructions.
4.0.36.ZC                       Updated the curver to reflect the latest version that might be identified by other
                                        users that perhaps previously downloaded 4.0.36.a from github.
                                Improved the upgrade process by allowing database upgrade without having to 
                                        remove all of the settings.  Now under certain conditions an upgrade link
                                        appears in the upper right hand corner when applicable.  Otherwise, can also
                                        activate manually like "always".
4.0.37                          - Product now can be exported by master_categories_id such that
                                        the product appears only one time in the export file.  The
                                        category assigned to the product in this export is the category
                                        that is identified as the master category.
                                  Modified the ep_supported_mods functionality and collection to
                                        compress the overall collection of associated data for supported
                                        modification display.  Existing variables remain in this version;
                                        however, will be deprecated in the future.
                                  Added additional variable unset commands to continue to minimize
                                        the amount of memory used by EP4.
                                  Improved custom field usage by ignoring spaces that might exist
                                        in the custom field, began development of incorporating fields
                                        from other tables in the export.
                                  Generated an array to capture maximum field length instead of
                                        individual variables.  Existing variables remain assigned at
                                        this time, but are to be deprecated in the future.
                                  Improved the implementation of the update function based on
                                        internal and ZC site version checking to properly implement
                                        the conditions when the Update Database option is presented.
                                  Added a check for an empty file to have been uploaded and
                                        associated error message.
                                  Removed pre-assignment of variables ($chosen_key) that will be assigned
                                        regardless.
                                  Improved the reporting of the product update to include identifying the
                                        $chosen_key that was used to update or try to update a product during import.
                                  Modified alignment of some code for readability and consistency.
                                  Added a csv delimiter selector.  This will generate the export file with the 
                                        selected delimiter (comma, semi-colon, tab, or space character).  As part of
                                        this also created a function to roughly identify the delimiter of a file being
                                        used to import.  This same function is used to display the delimiter of each
                                        import file that is present in the EP4 directory.  If it doesn't resolve 
                                        correctly there, it will not on import either.
                                  Moved the code to initiate the ZC load of information higher up in the sequence of
                                        loading so that EP4 could have more control over the processing of information.
                                  Modified the value of $price_with_tax to that of a number (1 for true and 0 for false).
                                        This way the value can be used in numerical calculations as a known value rather
                                        than an assumed/expected value.
                                  Ran EP4 through strict mode identifying areas of programming that may have been 
                                        incorrectly considered. (I.e testing if a value is first set to null then to 
                                        see if it is set which is first of all backwards and second unnecessarily 
                                        duplicates the test.)  This further reduces NOTICES generated to be ignored.
                                  Corrected a long standing test/check for the condition of a default language being defined.
                                  Reviewed/modified the code for PHP 7.2 known changes or potentially expected changes.
                                  Added a feature to set the exported filename such that a list of filenames will sort by
                                        calendar date by numeric year-mo-day .
                                  Added a timer reset as well as data to be pushed to the browser to try to prevent
                                        import and export failures.  Code should work provided that the site is not
                                        operating in safe mode.
                                  Added an import and export option to use the language code (ie. en for english, de
                                        for german, etc...).  Such a field will take priority over the historical
                                        number reference.
                                  Moved portions of the import code to a separate file to remove the code from the core.
                                  Relocated some code to reduce duplication.
                                  Incorporated the use of the AdminRequest Sanitizer class for data import.
                                  Modified/updated the add date for product so that will not store a value less than
                                        0001-01-01.
                                  Incorporated a test for the datatype sanitizer that would replace an entire string
                                        with the value of null if it contained NULL without affecting historical
                                        compatibility.
                                  Added the ability to delete specials from the database based on admin panel settings
                                        instead of keeping them disabled.
                                  Renamed the language folder deutsche to german to directly support the standard
                                        installation of ZC and expectation that the language directory be that of the
                                        English equivalent.
                                  Reworked the detailed attributes import to support omitting columns when importing data.
                                  Neue Konfigurationsoptionen auf deutsch übersetzt, Sprachdateien ergänzt
                                  Unterstützung für ältere Zen Cart Versionen entfernt
4.0.38  
                                  Neue Konfigurationseinstellung für Sprachkennung Override
                                  getestet mit 1.5.6 und PHP 7.3
